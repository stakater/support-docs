# Support FAQ

This section answers common questions about Stakater Support, SLA handling, escalation, and plan differences.

---

## 1. What is the difference between response time and resolution time?

**Response time** refers to the time it takes for a Stakater engineer to acknowledge and begin working on your ticket.

**Resolution time** refers to the time required to fully resolve the issue.

Stakater guarantees response times according to the selected support plan. Resolution time depends on technical complexity, root cause, and external dependencies.

---

## 2. What happens if I am on Standard and there is a P1 incident on Friday at 2 AM?

Under the **Standard** plan, support coverage is limited to Business Hours (8x5).

If a P1 incident occurs outside Business Hours — for example, Friday at 2 AM — the ticket will be handled when Business Hours resume.

For environments requiring immediate response outside Business Hours, the **Premium** plan is recommended, as it provides 24x7x365 coverage.

---

## 3. Can Stakater change the severity level of my ticket?

Yes.

If a ticket is misclassified, Stakater may adjust the severity based on actual business impact. Severity must reflect measurable impact on production systems.

---

## 4. Do you guarantee resolution times?

No.

Stakater guarantees initial response times according to the Support Plan & SLA. Resolution times cannot be guaranteed due to varying technical complexity and potential third-party dependencies.

---

## 5. Can I upgrade from Standard to Premium later?

Yes.

Support plans can be upgraded subject to commercial agreement. The upgraded SLA becomes effective once the agreement is finalized.

---

## 6. Does Premium include proactive guidance?

Yes.

Premium includes structured operational engagement, such as:

* Priority queue handling
* Senior engineering escalation
* Named technical contact (if agreed)
* Quarterly service review (if applicable)
* Proactive upgrade and operational recommendations

---

## 7. What if I run an unsupported product version?

Support applies to actively supported versions.

Running unsupported or end-of-life versions may limit support eligibility or require upgrade before full assistance can be provided.

---

## 8. What communication channels are used during incidents?

All tickets are tracked through the Support Portal.

For Premium customers, additional agreed channels (e.g., Slack or phone for P1) may be used for urgent coordination.

---

## 9. Does support include custom feature development?

No.

Custom development, architectural redesign, or major platform changes require a separate Professional Services engagement.

---

## 10. What qualifies as a P1 – Critical incident?

A P1 is declared when:

* Production service is unavailable, and
* No viable workaround exists, and
* Business operations are severely impacted

Detailed definitions are available in the **Severity & Response Framework**.
