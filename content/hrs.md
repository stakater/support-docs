SLA response times begin once the ticket is properly submitted.

## 3. Selecting the Correct Severity

Severity must reflect actual business impact.

* **P1 – Critical** → Production outage, no viable workaround.
* **P2 – High** → Major degradation with significant impact.
* **P3 – Medium** → Limited impact; workaround available.
* **P4 – Low** → Information request or minor issue.

If severity is incorrectly selected, Stakater may adjust it based on actual impact.

For detailed definitions, see **Severity & Response Framework**.

## 4. Provide Complete Information

To accelerate investigation, include:

* Environment (e.g., production, staging)
* Product or service affected
* Error messages or logs
* Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
* Impact description
* Any recent configuration changes

Incomplete information may delay resolution.

## 5. Share a Request with Other Users

By default, only the ticket creator can view a request.

To share it:

1. Open the request.
1. Add additional users in the **Shared with** field.
1. Those users will gain access and receive notifications.

## 6. Premium Customers – Critical Incident Escalation

If you are a **Premium** customer reporting a **P1 – Critical** issue:

1. Submit the ticket immediately via the Support Portal.
1. Use agreed emergency communication channels (e.g., Slack or phone) if applicable.

Escalation begins once the P1 ticket is logged.
