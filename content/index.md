# Support

Stakater monitors Stakater Services and Stakater's personnel will be automatically alerted on any service anomalies. Stakater's personnel will commence work on any issues in system operations requiring manual intervention without delay.

Our engineering support team doesn't just react to issues; we anticipate and work proactively to prevent them. We'll analyze trends, provide recommendations and in some cases, implement preventative measures to avoid future disruptions.

## Our Promise

We are here to support you, not just until the problem is solved, but to ensure that your experience is as seamless as possible. Your success is our success and through our ongoing response efforts, we pledge to uphold the highest standards of customer service and satisfaction.

## Priorities

You as a customer can set the initial priority for a Request by specifying the appropriate priority: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium` or `Low`. The Engineer on Duty has the right to adjust it at their own discretion based on the rules below:

| Request Priority | Description of the Request Priority |
| --- | --- |
| `Critical` |  Large-scale failure or complete unavailability of OpenShift or Customer's business application deployed on OpenShift. The `Critical` priority will be lowered to `High` if there is a workaround for the problem. Example: Router availability issues, synthetic monitoring availability issues. |
| `High` | Partial degradation of OpenShift core functionality or Customer's business application functionality with potential adverse impact on long-term performance. The `High` priority will be lowered to `Medium` if there is a workaround for the problem. Example: Node Group and Control Plane availability problems. |
| `Medium` | Partial, non-critical loss of functionality of OpenShift or the Customer's business application. This category also includes major bugs in OpenShift that affect some aspects of the Customer's operations and have no known solutions. The `Medium` priority will be lowered to `Low` if there is a workaround for the problem. This priority is assigned to Requests by default. If the Request does not have an priority set by the Customer, it will be assigned the default priority `Medium`. Example: Problems with the monitoring availability and Pod autoscaling. |
| `Low` | This category includes: Requests for information and other matters, requests regarding extending the functionality of the Kubernetes Platform, performance issues that have no effect on functionality, Kubernetes platform flaws with known solutions or moderate impact on functionality. Example: Issues with extension availability. |
