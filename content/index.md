# Support

Stakater operates 24/7/365 monitoring on Stakater Services and Stakater's personnel will be automatically alerted on any service anomalies. Stakater's personnel will commence work on any issues in system operations requiring manual intervention without delay.

Our engineering support team doesn't just react to issues; we anticipate and work proactively to prevent them. We'll analyze trends, provide recommendations and in some cases, implement preventative measures to avoid future disruptions.

Responses are provided on a best-effort basis during the same or next business day.

## Our Promise

We are here to support you, not just until the problem is solved, but to ensure that your experience is as seamless as possible. Your success is our success and through our ongoing response efforts, we pledge to uphold the highest standards of customer service and satisfaction.
