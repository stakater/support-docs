# Overview

Stakater provides structured, enterprise-grade support for all Stakater products and managed services.

## Support Plans

Stakater offers two support plans:

### **Standard**

Business-hours support designed for development environments, non-critical workloads, and cost-sensitive operations.

### **Premium**

24x7 support with priority handling, structured escalation, and proactive engagement — designed for production and business-critical workloads.

Each plan defines:

* Support coverage window
* Response time targets
* Escalation model
* Level of operational engagement

Full details are available in [**Support Plans & SLA**](plans.md).

## Consistent Severity Model

All Stakater products follow the same severity framework:

* **P1 – Critical**
* **P2 – High**
* **P3 – Medium**
* **P4 – Low**

Severity is based on business impact and determines response targets and escalation paths.

See [**Severity & Response Framework**](srf.md) for detailed definitions.
