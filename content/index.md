# Overview

Stakater provides structured, enterprise-grade support for all Stakater products and managed services.

Our support model is designed to be:

* Clear
* Predictable
* Consistent across products
* Aligned with production-grade operational needs

Whether you are running development environments or business-critical workloads, our support plans ensure you receive the right level of responsiveness and engagement.

## Support Plans

Stakater offers two support plans:

### **Standard**

Business-hours support designed for development environments, non-critical workloads, and cost-sensitive operations.

### **Premium**

24x7 support with priority handling, structured escalation, and proactive engagement — designed for production and business-critical workloads.

Each plan defines:

* Support coverage window
* Response time targets
* Escalation model
* Level of operational engagement

Full details are available in [**Support Plans & SLA**](plans.md).

## Consistent Severity Model

All Stakater products follow the same severity framework:

* **P1 – Critical**
* **P2 – High**
* **P3 – Medium**
* **P4 – Low**

Severity is based on business impact and determines response targets and escalation paths.

See [**Severity & Response Framework**](srf.md) for detailed definitions.

## How We Handle Incidents

Support is delivered by engineers with direct platform and product expertise.

Our process includes:

* Structured ticket intake
* Clear severity classification
* Defined response targets
* Escalation based on impact
* Transparent communication during critical incidents

Premium support includes priority queue handling and structured escalation paths.

See [**Incident Management Process**](./irm.md) for more information.

## Scope of Support

Stakater support focuses on:

* Incident investigation and remediation
* Product and platform troubleshooting
* Configuration guidance
* Operational best practices

Support does not replace professional services or custom development engagements.

See [**Service Scope & Responsibilities**](./ssr.md) for details.

## Our Approach

We believe strong support is not only about response time — it is about ownership, clarity, and operational maturity.

Two plans.
Clear SLAs.
Defined escalation paths.
No unnecessary complexity.
