# Support Plans & SLA

This policy applies to all Stakater products and managed services.

Stakater offers two support plans:

* **Standard**
* **Premium**

All severity definitions and SLA structures are consistent across products to ensure predictability and clarity.

## 1. Severity Definitions

All support plans use a unified four-level severity framework:

* P1 – Critical
* P2 – High
* P3 – Medium
* P4 – Low

Severity definitions and classification criteria are documented in the [**Severity & Response Framework**](./srf.md) section.

Severity determines response time targets and escalation handling.

If no severity is specified when submitting a request, it defaults to **P3 – Medium**.

Stakater reserves the right to adjust severity if misclassified based on actual business impact.

## 2. Response Time Matrix

Response time refers to **initial engagement by a Stakater engineer**, not resolution time.

| Severity          | Standard (Business Hours) | Premium (24x7x365) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **P1 – Critical** | 8 business hours          | 1 hour             |
| **P2 – High**     | 12 business hours         | 2 hours            |
| **P3 – Medium**   | 24 business hours         | 4 hours            |
| **P4 – Low**      | 24 business hours         | 1 business day     |

**Business Hours**: Monday–Friday, excluding public holidays.

Premium response targets apply 24x7x365.

## 3. Support Channels

All support requests must be submitted via the **Support Portal** to ensure proper tracking and SLA compliance.

| Channel                           | Standard | Premium |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Support Portal                    | ✔        | ✔       |
| Slack (shared channel, if agreed) | –        | ✔       |
| Phone (P1 incidents)              | –        | ✔       |

Slack and phone access under Premium must be agreed in advance.

## 4. Support Coverage

| Plan         | Coverage           |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| **Standard** | 8x5 Business Hours |
| **Premium**  | 24x7x365           |

Premium includes round-the-clock support across all priorities.

## 5. Enterprise Support Differentiation

The difference between Standard and Premium is not only response time — it is operational depth and engagement.

| Capability                                | Standard   | Premium  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Shared Support Queue                      | ✔          | –        |
| Priority Support Queue                    | –          | ✔        |
| Direct Senior Engineer Escalation         | Limited    | ✔        |
| Named Technical Contact                   | –          | ✔        |
| Quarterly Service Review                  | –          | ✔        |
| Proactive Architecture & Upgrade Guidance | On Request | Included |
| Incident Trend Analysis & Recommendations | –          | ✔        |
| Management Escalation Path                | On Request | Included |

Premium is designed for business-critical environments requiring structured, proactive engagement.
