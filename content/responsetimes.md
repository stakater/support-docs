# Response Framework

## Initial Response Time and Our Commitment to You

Once we've addressed your initial support request, our commitment doesn't end there. We believe in providing continuous support to ensure that your issue is resolved satisfactorily. Our ongoing response framework is designed to keep you informed and confident that we're working diligently to address your needs.

## Ongoing Response

Depending on severity of your issue we will keep you in the loop and inform you of our progress. With high severity cases we would also provide our next steps as well as next follow up, either via the support engineering team or, if applicable, via your designated customer success manager.
Preferred method of contact is stated in your support contract or otherwise through any of the stated communication channels.

## Feedback Loop

Your feedback during and after the resolution process helps us improve. We'll check in with you to ensure your satisfaction and learn how we can enhance our support.

## Resolution and Review

Once an issue is resolved, we'll conduct a review with you to ensure everything is working as it should. Weâ€™ll also discuss any lessons learned and potential improvements for both parties.
