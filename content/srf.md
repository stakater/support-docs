# Severity & Response Framework

This section defines how Stakater classifies incidents and how communication and follow-up are handled after initial response.

The framework applies uniformly across all Stakater products and services.

## 1. Severity Classification

Severity is determined based on business impact.

| Severity          | Definition                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1 – Critical** | Production outage or severe business impact. No viable workaround exists.                                   |
| **P2 – High**     | Major degradation of production functionality. A workaround may exist but is not sustainable.               |
| **P3 – Medium**   | Limited or non-critical functionality affected. A reasonable workaround exists.                             |
| **P4 – Low**      | Information requests, configuration guidance, minor issues, or enhancement questions. No production impact. |

Severity influences response time targets and escalation handling.

If no severity is selected when submitting a request, it defaults to **P3 – Medium**.

Stakater reserves the right to adjust severity based on actual business impact.

## 2. Initial Response

Initial response refers to acknowledgement and engagement by a Stakater engineer.

During initial response, the assigned engineer will:

* Validate severity and impact
* Begin investigation
* Request additional information if required
* Outline immediate next steps

Response time targets are defined in the **Support Plans & SLA** section.

## 3. Ongoing Communication

Support does not end at first response. Communication continues until the issue is resolved or formally closed.

Communication frequency depends on severity:

### P1 – Critical

* Active investigation begins immediately.
* Regular updates provided until service stability is restored.
* Escalation initiated automatically under Premium.

### P2 – High

* Progress updates provided during investigation.
* Escalation as required based on impact and complexity.

### P3 – Medium

* Updates provided as investigation progresses.
* Follow-up communication aligned with business-hours coverage.

### P4 – Low

* Response and follow-up provided within standard SLA timelines.

Communication is handled via the Support Portal unless otherwise agreed.

## 4. Escalation Model

Escalation is triggered by:

* Business impact
* Lack of progress
* Customer request (if justified)

Under Premium support, P1 incidents are automatically escalated to senior engineering.

Management visibility is introduced when required based on severity and operational impact.

## 5. Resolution

An incident is considered resolved when:

* Service functionality is restored, or
* A verified workaround is implemented, or
* The customer confirms closure

Resolution may involve:

* Configuration changes
* Bug fixes
* Vendor coordination
* Upgrade recommendations

Resolution time is not guaranteed and depends on technical complexity and external dependencies.

## 6. Post-Incident Review

For high-severity incidents, Stakater may conduct a structured review.

This may include:

* Root cause analysis
* Timeline reconstruction
* Preventative recommendations
* Operational improvement suggestions

Under Premium support, post-incident reviews may be formally included as part of service engagement.

## 7. Continuous Improvement

Stakater uses incident data and trends to improve platform stability and operational processes.

Feedback during and after case resolution is welcomed and may be incorporated into product and service improvements.
