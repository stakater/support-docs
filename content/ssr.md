# Service Scope & Responsibilities

This section defines what is included in Stakater Support, what is not included, and how responsibilities are shared between Stakater and the customer.

This applies to all Stakater products and managed services unless otherwise defined in a separate agreement.

## 1. Scope of Support

Stakater Support focuses on maintaining the stability, reliability, and operational integrity of Stakater products and managed services.

Support includes:

* Incident investigation and remediation
* Troubleshooting of Stakater products and managed environments
* Configuration guidance
* Operational best practice recommendations
* Upgrade and lifecycle guidance (reactive under Standard, proactive under Premium)
* Coordination with upstream vendors when required (if related to supported components)

Support is delivered through the structured process defined in the Incident Response Management framework.

## 2. What Is Not Included

The following are outside the scope of standard support:

* Custom feature development
* Major architectural redesign projects
* New environment design or migration projects
* Customer application debugging (unless directly caused by Stakater platform issues)
* Third-party software licensing or compliance management
* Performance tuning of customer workloads beyond platform-level guidance
* Business process consulting
* Security assessments or audits (unless separately contracted)

Such activities may be delivered under a separate Professional Services agreement.

## 3. Shared Responsibility Model

Effective platform operation requires collaboration.

### Stakater Responsibilities

Stakater is responsible for:

* Stability and functionality of supported Stakater products
* Management of supported infrastructure components (where applicable)
* Incident response and mitigation within the supported scope
* Maintaining operational processes and escalation paths
* Implementing fixes for product defects

### Customer Responsibilities

The customer is responsible for:

* Accurate severity classification
* Providing timely and complete information during investigation
* Maintaining supported versions (unless managed service agreement states otherwise)
* Secure configuration of customer workloads
* Application-level debugging and validation
* Compliance with licensing obligations for third-party software
* Acting on recommendations provided by Stakater where appropriate

Delays in providing required information may impact resolution timelines.

## 4. Environment Boundaries

Support scope depends on the engagement type:

### Product Support (e.g., Operators, Software Products)

* Covers the Stakater product itself
* Covers documented integrations
* Does not cover full infrastructure management unless explicitly contracted

### Managed Services (e.g., Stakater Cloud, KubeCare+)

* Covers managed infrastructure components
* Covers platform-level monitoring and remediation
* Does not extend to customer application code unless separately agreed

Scope boundaries are defined in the applicable Order Form or Master Agreement.

## 5. Third-Party Dependencies

Where incidents involve upstream or third-party vendors:

* Stakater will assist with diagnosis and coordination if within supported scope
* Resolution timelines may depend on external vendor response
* Stakater cannot guarantee third-party resolution times

## 6. Change & Enhancement Requests

Requests that involve:

* New capabilities
* Structural design changes
* Custom automation
* Platform expansion

Will be evaluated separately and may require:

* A scoped engagement
* Commercial approval
* A Professional Services agreement

## 7. Version & Lifecycle Policy

Support applies to:

* Actively supported product versions
* Documented compatibility matrices

Running unsupported or end-of-life versions may limit support eligibility.

## 8. Commercial Terms & Service Credits

Support response times are governed by the Support Plans & SLA section.

Service credits, if applicable, are only granted if explicitly defined in a commercial agreement.
